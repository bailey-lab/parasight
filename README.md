# parasight

Installation should be fairly easyâ€”the website has general install instructions
towards the end. I definitely recommend UNIX over running it on Windows.
However, if you have no choice, I have managed to iron out most of the Windows
inadequacies/bugs.

To install the program and the example script:

1. Install Perl if not installed (most standard unix installs have all that is
   required).
   1. For unix see www.perl.org, although for most unix computers Perl is part
      of the standard install.
   2. For MS Windows, try [ActiveState
      Perl](http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/). They have already
      compiled a binary so you don't.
2. You may download the program from the website and uncompress the file or
   clone the repository.
3. Directly within the directory is the parasight executable, it should either
   be moved or linked into your bin path for ease of use. On windows machines
   that have installed ActiveState the simplest solution is to place it in the
   Perl bin directory (usually `C:\Perl\bin`). Parasight code no longer
   requires additional modules except for Tk.
4. Check to see if parasight runs by typing parasight at a command line. You
   should get a summary of options.
5. If it doesn't work you may need to fix the path or install any modules such
   as Tk but only if it complains that they are not found.
6. Once you get parasight to run (i.e. list its main options when run without
   any arguments), try changing to the examples directory and running
   `parasight_examples1.pl -example 1`. This is a cheesy scripted tutorial that
   will demonstrate some of the things parasight can do. This program won't run
   unless it can find parasight (i.e. after you put it in a bin directory). You
   need to execute `parasight_examples1.pl` in its directory so it can find the
   example data.
7. The other examples aren't really scripted but they are examples to give you
   ideas of what parasight can do and how to go about getting parasight doing
   it.

Enjoy,
